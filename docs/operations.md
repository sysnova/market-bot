# Operations

The `marketbot` command is the stable operator entry point. Its `rules`, `strategy`, `audit`,
`supervisor`, and `infra` groups are registered even when an optional operator module is absent. An
absent module reports that fact and never pretends an operation succeeded.

```shell
uv run marketbot --help
uv run marketbot --version
```

Production configuration should be provided as `MARKETBOT_*` environment variables by the runtime.
Do not mount or log `.env` files in production. Treat the URLs as secrets because they may contain
credentials.

JSON logs are the default. Bind a `correlation_id`, message ID, or command ID at entry points and
clear context at the end of every request/message to avoid context leakage between tasks.

`compose.yaml` is solely a workstation convenience. Production NATS and PostgreSQL lifecycle,
backup, TLS, authentication, and monitoring belong to the deployment platform.

## Native NATS service on Windows

For a persistent Windows development broker, run the repository installer from an elevated
PowerShell process:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/windows/install-nats-service.ps1
```

The installer downloads the pinned official NATS archive, verifies its SHA-256 checksum, and
registers `MarketBotNATS` as an automatic Windows service running as `NetworkService`. The client
and monitoring listeners bind only to localhost:

- `nats://127.0.0.1:4222`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8222`

JetStream state and logs live under `C:\ProgramData\MarketBot\NATS`. The service can be inspected
and controlled with standard Windows commands:

```powershell
Get-Service MarketBotNATS
Start-Service MarketBotNATS
Stop-Service MarketBotNATS
```

Validate MarketBot against the native broker with:

```powershell
$env:NATS_URL = "nats://127.0.0.1:4222"
uv run pytest app/event_bus/tests/test_nats_integration.py -m integration --no-cov
```
