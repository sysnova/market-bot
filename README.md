# MarketBot

MarketBot is a Python 3.14 event-driven market automation monorepo. Engines are isolated under
`app/<engine>/`; they communicate through stable contracts rather than direct imports.

## Prerequisites

- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) 0.11 or newer
- Python 3.14 (installed automatically by `uv` when downloads are available)
- Docker only if you choose to run the optional local NATS/PostgreSQL stack

No local Docker daemon, NATS instance, database, or secret is required for quality checks and unit
tests.

## Bootstrap

```shell
uv python install 3.14
uv sync --locked
uv run marketbot --help
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` only when running components that need infrastructure. Pydantic reads
all process settings from the `MARKETBOT_` namespace.

## Development gates

```shell
uv run ruff check .
uv run pyright
uv run pytest -m "not integration"
```

The test suite enforces at least 80% branch-aware coverage. Tests needing external services must use
the `integration` marker.

## Optional local infrastructure

For hosts that already have Docker Compose:

```shell
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

This starts NATS 2.12 with JetStream and PostgreSQL 17. It is a convenience for integration work,
not a prerequisite for local development.

See [architecture](docs/architecture.md), [development](docs/development.md), and
[operations](docs/operations.md) for repository-wide guidance.
